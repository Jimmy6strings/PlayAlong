PlayAlong

A music video app designed for the musician who wants to play along.

PlayAlong is a music video app that allows the user to play along with any music video they have searched by rendering a chord progression music sheet under the music video screen. With the chords given, the user can select from any instrument they have to be able to play along with the song.

The problem this app solves is the ability to play along with a song, learning the chord changes of the song, while attuning to the melody of the song.

This app solves this problem by not only providing a way for the user to look up the song in any form (using Youtube to find a music video, song with lyrics, etc.), but also giving the chords and how they are played on a music sheet.

To get started, simply open up the app, search for a song and that's it! Users who sign up will have the ability to queue the songs they want to learn and re-learn.
